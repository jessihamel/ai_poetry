# Can an A.I. read poetry?

This project is a small app that allows you to compare your own interpretation of a poem with that of a natural language processing algorithm ([IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/)). The algorithm results can be a jumping off point for thinking about the poems and their slippery, sometimes contradictory tones. The tangram and stained-glass inspired graphs with their blended colors are meant to capture some of this ambiguity, giving each poem its own loose visual feel.
